# Hi there I'm Luka 👋

## About Me 

- 👽 Very forward-thinking, I'm always down to use the latest stuff when I'm working.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on some NFT stuff based on the FLOW Blockchain
- 👉 Some of the stuff I use daily is JavaScript, Node.js, React, Recoil & The FLOW Blockchain language Cadence.
- 👩‍🎨 When I'm not coding I'm probably making music in Ableton or designing stuff in Figma/Photoshop. I think UX Design is pretty cool too.
