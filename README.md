## About Me 

- Forward-thinking, I'm always down to use the latest stuff when I'm working.
- Currently working on some NFT stuff based on the FLOW Blockchain
- Some of the stuff I use daily is JavaScript, Node.js, React, Recoil & The FLOW Blockchain language Cadence.
- When I'm not coding I'm probably making music in Ableton or designing stuff in Figma/Photoshop. I think UX Design is pretty cool too.
